## Overview
We were building a blog application that is designed to be responsive no matter what device you are viewing the blogger's material. 
The blog is designed to be desktop, mobile and tablet friendly for the user. 

## Getting Started
1. Forked lab repo
2. Cloned lap repo
3. Copied lab repo
4. Created working working branch
5. Found TODO items and completed; checked work in live-server during TODO updates; referenced SMACCS protocal 
6. Found REVIEW items and commented; referenced online material for review of 'Character References' 

## Architecture
The architecture of the applications uses HTML and CSS
